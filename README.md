# Smart CD Collection Assistant


This project is a **capstone project** for the [**Kaggle 5-Day AI Agents Intensive Course with Google**](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/agents-intensive-capstone-project]),under the track *Concierge Agents*.


## 🎯 Project Goal & Motivation

I have a growing CD collection and want a clear, searchable record of what I own.
Manually typing all CD details is tedious and error-prone, so this project aims to build a simple AI agent that streamlines the process.
By using the **Discogs API** to fetch reliable metadata, the agent can speed up cataloging, reduce manual input, and make searching more accessible and accurate.

## 🧩 Current Scope

* **Add CDs** to the collection through natural-language prompts
* **Search CDs** by title, artist, genre, year, and more
* **Store and update** collection data in a structured format (currently using Google Sheets)

These core features form the foundation.
Further extensions (advanced metadata enrichment, automation workflows, analytics, etc.) may come later but are **not included in the initial version**.

## Status

Initial development — focusing on adding items to the collection and searching through them.
